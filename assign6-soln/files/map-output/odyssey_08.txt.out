our 1
second 1
progress 1
to 1
my 1
royal 1
friend 1
and 1
him 1
amidst 1
his 1
jovial 1
sons 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
banquet 1
steaming 1
and 1
the 1
goblets 1
crownd 1
there 1
humbly 1
stoopd 1
with 1
conscious 1
shame 1
and 1
awe 1
nor 1
nearer 1
than 1
the 1
gate 1
presumed 1
to 1
draw 1
but 1
soon 1
his 1
sons 1
their 1
wellknown 1
guest 1
descried 1
and 1
starting 1
from 1
their 1
couches 1
loudly 1
cried 1
ulysses 1
here 1
what 1
demon 1
couldst 1
thou 1
meet 1
to 1
thwart 1
thy 1
passage 1
and 1
repel 1
thy 1
fleet 1
wast 1
thou 1
not 1
furnishd 1
by 1
our 1
choicest 1
care 1
for 1
greece 1
for 1
home 1
and 1
all 1
thy 1
soul 1
held 1
dear 1
thus 1
they 1
in 1
silence 1
long 1
my 1
fate 1
i 1
mournd 1
at 1
length 1
these 1
words 1
with 1
accents 1
low 1
returnd 1
me 1
lockd 1
in 1
sleep 1
my 1
faithless 1
crew 1
bereft 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
blessing 1
of 1
your 1
godlike 1
gift 1
but 1
grant 1
oh 1
grant 1
our 1
loss 1
we 1
may 1
retrieve 1
a 1
favour 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
alone 1
can 1
give 1
thus 1
i 1
with 1
art 1
to 1
move 1
their 1
pity 1
tried 1
and 1
touchd 1
the 1
youths 1
but 1
their 1
stern 1
sire 1
replied 1
vile 1
wretch 1
begone 1
this 1
instant 1
i 1
command 1
thy 1
fleet 1
accursed 1
to 1
leave 1
our 1
hallowd 1
land 1
his 1
baneful 1
suit 1
pollutes 1
these 1
blessd 1
abodes 1
whose 1
fate 1
proclaims 1
him 1
hateful 1
to 1
the 1
gods 1
thus 1
fierce 1
he 1
said 1
we 1
sighing 1
went 1
our 1
way 1
and 1
with 1
desponding 1
hearts 1
put 1
off 1
to 1
sea 1
the 1
sailors 1
spent 1
with 1
toils 1
their 1
folly 1
mourn 1
but 1
mourn 1
in 1
vain 1
no 1
prospect 1
of 1
return 1
six 1
days 1
and 1

a 1
doubtful 1
course 1

of 1

within 1
a 1
long 1
recess 1

round 1
with 1

the 1

below 1
no 1
tracks 1

smoky 1
volumes 1
rolling 1
from 1

two 1
with 1
our 1

thither 1
we 1
command 1
with 1
